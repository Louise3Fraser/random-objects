      "Kyawthuite is the rarest mineral on earth. It is so rare, in fact, that only one specimen has ever been discovered (creds to Dr. Kyaw Thu -- Burmese gemologist).",

      "Wondering how small the 1.61 carats actually is? It's roughly the weight of 15-20 grains of salt! It's a wonder this gem was found at all. Makes me wonder how many other rare minerals are out there, waiting to be discovered."

      "This beautiful creature is the world's largest butterfly. It was discovered by collector Albert Stewart Meek on an expedition to collect natural history specimens from New Guinea (unfortunately, he shot it down--it's still available for view in the National History Museum in London.)",
      "The Queen Alexandra's birdwing can have a wingspan of up to 11 inches (28 cm). Experts question why the butterfly evolved to be this large. Some theories suggest it may offer greater protection from predators, or that it evolved to feed from larger, less competitive flower sources."
